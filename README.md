A JavaFX based, scientific & graphing calculator.

Computation is handled by a recursive-descent parser, that builds abstract expression trees. Parser implementation was [adapted from public domain code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3422673/how-to-evaluate-a-math-expression-given-in-string-form) to include variable evaluation, and ahead-of-time compilation of the expression, expanded unary function support, and more.
