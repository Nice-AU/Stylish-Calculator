A JavaFX based, scientific & graphing calculator.

This project belonged to Jocelyn by Maven, but It's a modified project from me with Ant due to the enter key was not detected & due some more other issues, the jar exist in the Dist folder, you can take jar & call main class to use the calculator, you can update method signature to public method if issue exist, I may will update this project more while it's already my hard time given to modify it's.
